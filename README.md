A Game of Thrones Simulation

The GUI was mostly provided before by the instructors. 
All backend code was written by Adarsh Suresh.

To run, compile all the java files and run the Westeros.class that is created.

To use simply select the family you want to add to the game board and click anywhere to create an instance of that class.

Add as many diffent players as you want and watch them fight it out on the Westeros game board.
